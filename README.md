# 💘 Valentine's Proposal App

A romantic, interactive, and playful Single Page Application (SPA) built to ask the big question in style. Features a mischievous "No" button that is impossible to click, progressive UI animations, and a grand confetti finale!

## ✨ Features

- **🏃‍♂️ Unclickable "No" Button:** The button intelligently evades the cursor and touch inputs, teleporting to safe corners of the screen to ensure a "Yes"!
- **📈 Growing "Yes" Button:** Every rejection attempt makes the "Yes" button larger, subtly encouraging the right choice.
- **🎭 Reactive GIFs:** A curated sequence of cute "Milk & Mocha" and "Bubu Dudu" GIFs that react to the user's hesitation (Shocked, Crying, Angry, etc.).
- **🎉 Celebration Mode:** Triggers a massive, 15-second confetti explosion and a "It's a Date!" success screen upon acceptance.
- **📱 Fully Mobile Responsive:** Optimized for all devices with smart positioning logic that prevents buttons from going off-screen on phones.
- **💅 Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, translucent card design with a beautiful animated gradient background.
- **🖥️ Smart Fullscreen:** Automatically attempts to enter immersive fullscreen mode on interaction.
